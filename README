ABOUT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A little class project to generate interactive fractals.

In more detail, the project is built on a Altera DE2 FPGA (Cyclone II)
development board, dispatching the calculation of pixel colors from a
"soft" Nios II processor to hardware fractal calculators working in
parallel, which are then stored in a frame buffer and displayed
through VGA. The parameters used to generate the fractal are dynamic,
mutable by buttons or some other input.


TODO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You should see either 1) github issues, or 2) our heads. Or the docs/
directory, we've likely put our latest and greatest out there.
